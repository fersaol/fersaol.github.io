            Try your luck running in a Jupyter Notebook this lottery game so you can know what to
            expect in advance while playing lottery. In this game you can simulate that you play
            lottery, let's say once every day during 100 years, and know how many times you will 
            would have won the lottery. I won the lottery 2 times in 1000 years, would you be luckier
            than me?.<br>
