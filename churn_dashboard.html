                                <p style="color: blueviolet;">Churn Dashboard made for the Bank's customer churning data analysis and prediction project
									where you can get your own insights and take a look at the data used for the Streamlit app which
									leverages a scipy supervised machine learning algorithm for binary classification.

                            <p align="justify">This project has been made using python Dash library for the frontend, showing the figures, and
								has been put available for the public using the AWS Cloud. For this infrastructure we have used
								the following AWS services:
								<ul>
									<li><strong>CloudFront:</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
									<li><strong>Route 53:</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
									<li><strong>ACM:</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
									<li><strong>ALB (Application Load Balancer):</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
									<li><strong>ECS (Elastic Conatiners Service):</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
									<li><strong>ECR (Elastic Container Registry):</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
									<li><strong>Fargate:</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
									
								</ul>

								And we have put them together following the diagram showed below:

                    </section>
					<div class="container">
						<p align="justify">
							As we can see in the diagram our infrastructure is based on containers using the AWS Elastic Containers Service.
							This containers run on top of the AWS compute service Fargate, which is a managed service by AWS. 
							The tasks are defined by our task definition based on the image stored in the Elastic Container Registry. This image
							uses python as the base layer and contains the data, the app and all the dependencies needed to run as well as a gunicorn
							server, which is recommended to run Dash python apps.
							All our tasks run inside an ECS cluster and this is placed inside a target group so we can connect them with our application 
							load balancer. This load balancer is in charge of distribute the traffic load among the tasks and it is able to determine
							if the tasks are healthy or not, replacing them in this later case, with the aim of the Auto Scaling Group capability provided
							by EC2 service.
							In our Application Load Balancer we also have set up two listners, one for secure traffic on port 443 using ssl certificates associated
							to it and another for insecure traffic on port 80. All the traffic reaching our load balancer on port 443 is allowed but if traffic is
							received on port 80, we have set up a redirection rule in this listener and the traffic is automatically redirected to port 443.
							On the oter hand, on the secure traffic listener we have set up a rule pointing to our target group when it is received an http request 
							containing a heder with our domain.
							It is also worth mentioning that, for faster network communications, we use inside AWS port 80 for services communication. As it would be
							requests sent from the Application load balancer to the targets, using the the ALB feature SSL termination. This way we talk outside
							of AWS, in the public network, using encrypted communications and inside AWS unencrypted communications.
							The domain is a record created in our DNS registrar Route 53. In the hosted zone, which contains the name servers we have created
							a record with the name and value provided by ACM (Authority Certification Manager) to be able to encrypt our in flight traffic while
							connecting through the public internet so we can allow our customers to have secure connections with our application.
							Finally, to distribute our content faster with low latency globally we are using the AWS Contend Delivery Service called 
							CloudFront.
