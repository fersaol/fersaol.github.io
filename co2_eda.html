							<p style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="https://github.com/fersaol/co2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis">Github</a></h2></p>
						<h3>About the Dataset</h3>
						The dataset contains features regarding to energy production and co2 emissions from
						the countries in the world, ranging a period of time that goes through 1989 up to 2020.
						We can encounter features as the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Country - Country in question</li>
							<li>Energy_type - Type of energy source</li>
							<li>Year - Year the data was recorded</li>
							<li>Energy_consumption - Amount of Consumption for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)</li>
							<li>Energy_production - Amount of Production for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)</li>
							<li>GDP - Countries GDP at purchasing power parities, measured (Billion 2015$ PPP)</li>
							<li>Population - Population of specific Country, measured (Mperson)</li>
							<li>Energyintensityper_capita - Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy.
								It is calculated as units of energy per unit of capita (capita = individual person), measured (MMBtu/person)</li>
							<li>Energyintensityby_GDP- Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is
								calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP, measred (1000 Btu/2015$ GDP PPP)</li>
							<li>CO2_emission - The amount of C02 emitted, measured (MMtonnes CO2)</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Checking the data</h3>
						<h4>Head,Tail and Sample</h4>
						We encounter that we have features with very different scales and that we have nulls. Also
						we see that the energy_type variable is a string, Year is an integer variable and should be parsed.
						The dataset also have an Unnamed: 0 column that is not worthy and should be removed as well as Country
						is also a string variable, being the rest numeric ones.<hr>
						<h4>Info</h4>
						If we check the info we can realize about the beforehand information and we can know exactly how many
						nulls there are in every single feature, we see this in the picture below:
						<img src="images/eda_images/info.png" width="600"/>
						folowing with the description of our dataset, we first drop the Unnamed column, and then we check the
						describe of the features:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_describe.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						First of all we can see that having year as an integer does not make any sense so we are changing it to
						datetime. We also see that Energy consumption and Energy production both have similar values, so the scale
						is close to each other, and gdp has a very high standard deviation. This indicate there is a big difference 
						in terms of GDP between countries being the minimum 0.124 and the maximum 127690.24. On energy consumption, 
						energy production and co2 emission we see that means are respectively 1.538, 1.532 and 78.8 but the maximum
						values are 601, 611 and 35.584, moreover the 75% data is concentrared until 0.209 for energy consumption, 0.112
						for energy production and 4.32 for co2 emission what it can indicate there is outliers in our dataset. But we will
						check all this out later.
						Finally, we set the next steps to follow:
						<ol>
							<li>we should convert Year into a datetime variable</li>
							</li>From the energy_consumption column are null values, we need to identify them and decide if we remove or replace them.</li>
							<li>The Energy_consumption minimum is negative so we have to look up if this has sense. We also have to discover if 25% of the data that is accumulated till 0 makes sense too.</li>
							<li>In Energy production happens the same as in Energy_consumption, however for 50 and 75 percentiles it can make sense the country has a negative production if these countries do not produce energy enough and they have to import it, being its balance negative. In this case, the variable would be a net balance and we beleive is not the case, we should check it out.</li>
							<li>The maximum value for GDP is very high, we should check out this is not an outlier, and make the same for the minimum. Wrapping up, to check outliers.</li>
							<li>Intensity per capita and GDP have also possible outliers, check them out too, and in general.</li>
							<li>On co2 emissions we see there are negative values, Does this make sense?, and the 50% of values are cumulated until 0, Does this make sense too?. However, the maximum value is too high resulting in a high standar deviation, This also make sense?.</li>
						</ol>
						First, let's convert Year to datetime:
						<pre><code>df.Year = pd.to_datetime(df.Year,format="%Y")</code></pre>
						Then let's see what percentage of null values we have in each feature:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_deda_nulos.png" width="600" height="250"/>
						<h5>Energy_consumption nulls</h5>
						They are distribuited almost equally by years:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_nulosanio.png" width="600" height="250"/>
						By country, we can see that the majority of the null values comes from very small countries as 
						Hawaiian Trade Zone, Germany West, Former Yugoslavia, Palestinian Territories or Namibia among others, 
						which are possible at that time they were involved into a war, or they were not attached to the 
						collection system or they are just developing countries and they were not able to provide data. 
						There are also developed countries, but in much less quantity, and it can be due an error. 
						Let's see the graph:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_nullpais.png" width="600" height="250"/>
						Now, let's take a closer look to the 20 countries with most nulls:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_20largest.png" width="600" height="300"/>
						Although we have nulls in almost all countries and years, we can appreciate that our idea was 
						not too wrong. This way we can see that the 20 countries with more nulls are countries which does no 
						longer already exists, as East and West Germany or the URSS, or they are developing countries, which are the 
						majority. Due to the high number of null data in these countries we have decided to drop them. 
						Doing this we are going to also drop a very homogeneus amount of data by year.
						<h5>Energy_production nulls</h5>
						We have gotten the same insights about energy_production so we have taken the same actions as before.
						(Anyways the code relating to this variable can be checked on the github link for more detail)
						<h5>GDP, Population, Energy_intensity_per_capita, Energy_intensity_by_GDP and CO2_emission</h5>
						They do not represent a large proportion of the data. In this sense, the GDP would be considered that in the 
						years that there has been no data, the gdp remained constant. With the population we could assume the same 
						criterion, in the years that there was no data, the population remained constant. so we have decided to 
						imput the nans as follows:
						<ul>
							<li><b>GDP:</b>we are using the panda's method backfill</li>
							<li><b>Population:</b>we are also using the panda's method backfill</li>
						</ul>
							The intensity indices per capita have even fewer nulls in relation to the total data and since they 
							are a quotient that includes the previous variables, I believe that the same method should be adopted 
							to maintain homogeneity:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Energy_intensity_per_capita:</b>we are using the panda's method backfill</li>
							<li><b>Energy_intensity_by_GDP:</b>we are using the panda's method backfill</li>
						</ul>
						Finally, in relation to CO2 emissions, it seems to me, given the decisions taken previously, and for the 
						same reasons, to apply the same method. Since we do not have data, we are assuming that the data of the 
						period prior to the null were kept constant and I think it is a good method in this case:
						<ul>
							<li><b>CO2_emission:</b>we are using the panda's method backfill</li>
						</ul>
						Now that we have no nulls in our dataset, let's check how they are distribuited:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_consprodistri.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_conprodistracum.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						We can see that the vast majority of the data is accumulated around 0 with just some big values, we could interpret
						this because of the big differences between a little number of countries that have very large numbers related with 
						the rest. This fact punts on the table the inequality regarding to energy production and consumption in the world.
						Let's make a plot with the rest of variables:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_alldistributions.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_alldistributionsacum.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						We can appreciate that any of the variables have a normal distribution. It could be that this is not very clear watching
						just the aggregated data itself so we are going to zoom in at some countries to see how they are distribuited:
						<h5>Albania</h5>
						<img src="images/eda_images/albania.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						<h5>Afghanistan</h5>
						<img src="images/eda_images/afganistan.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						At the moment what I can see in the histograms is that although the number of data referring to each 
						of the countries is distributed in a more or less uniform way, the variables are not distributed in such 
						a way. For example, GDP, population, energy consumption and production, CO2 emissions are not distributed 
						evenly, but are concentrated near zero. On the other hand, the types of energy used are distributed evenly.
						We removed the data labeled world,because it was just the aggregated sum, but does not change the picture 
						of the data by individual countries.
						Let's see how the data grouped by country looks like, on average:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_consumpall.png" width="600" height="500"/>
						Here we can corroborate the distribution that we saw in the histogram, where three countries clearly 
						monopolize energy consumption and therefore the same will happen with co2 emissions and with the 
						production and the rest of the countries are concentrated around 0 and 9.86. In this way, 
						that 25 percent accumulated up to 0 makes sense. let's take a closer look to the biggest ones:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_15consum.png" width="600" height="300"/>
						<h4>Negative Numbers</h4>
						The first thing we are going to check is the types of energy related with negative numbers, for that we
						make:
						<pre><code>menos_cero = df[df.Energy_consumption < 0] 
menos_cero.Energy_type.unique() 

OUTPUT:
array(['renewables_n_other'], dtype=object)
						</code></pre>
						We see that all negative energy consumption is due to the type of renewable generation, and it makes sense,
						since being renewable, they do not consume energy for its production but rather contribute it to the system 
						and hence the data is negative. In this sense, we keep the negative data in the dataframe.
						<h4>Energy production negative numbers</h4>
						In energy production the same thing happens as in Energy_consumption, however for the 50th and 75th percentiles 
						it may make sense for the country to have a negative production if these do not produce enough energy and have to 
						import it from abroad and their balance is negative. In that case, the variable would be a net balance and I think 
						that is not the case, check it.
						<pre><code>menos_cero_prod = df[df.Energy_production < 0]
print(f"todos los valores corresponden a {menos_cero_prod.Country.unique()} con un total de {len(menos_cero_prod)})

OUTPUT:
todos los valores corresponden a Qatar con un total de 6 valores
						</code></pre>
						We see that the negative values ​​corresponding to energy production all correspond to Qatar and included in the 
						period from 1984 to 1995. We can see that it had no consumption, and that production, can also be considered zero. 
						In other words, Qatar in these periods does not produce or consume renewable energy, so we are going to eliminate them. 
						This is due, as we have been able to read, to the fact that Qatar is the largest gas exporter in the world and has never 
						needed to worry about renewables, so it began to worry about this around the year 2019.
						<pre><code>df = df.drop(menos_cero_prod.index)</code></pre>
						<h4>The maximum GDP is very high, confirm that it is not an outlier and do the same for the minimum. Check the outliers in general.</h4>
						For this part first we filter our features choosing only the numeric ones:
						<pre><code>df_continuas = df.select_dtypes(exclude=["object","datetime64"])</code></pre>
						then, we plot them using boxplots:
						<img src="images/eda_images/boxplots.png" width="600" height="300"/>
						Given the data distribution seen before in which most of the energy production and consumption, as well as CO2 emissions 
						and population are concentrated in a few countries, we consider the boxplots we see to be normal and we cannot consider 
						there are outliers. In Energy_intensity_by_GDP we could see that we have two outliers but it is not worth removing them.
						Let's check countries' population:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_population.png" width="600" height="600"/>
						As we can not see properly the data, althoug we can spot the general trend in the world population, let's focus on the 5
						world largest populated countries:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_5_largestpop.png" width="600" height="300"/>
						We see how the majority of the population is concentrated in China, India, the United States and Indonesia, and hence that boxplot, 
						we cannot put them as outliers.
						<h4>7. In co2 emissions we see that the minimum is negative, does it make sense?. By the other hand, 50% of the values ​​acummulate 
						until 0 as well, does that make sense?. However, the maximum is very high, which gives us a very high standard deviation as well, 
						does that make sense?</h4>
						let's see how many negative data we have in the co2_emission variable:
						<pre><code>emisiones_negativas = df[df.CO2_emission < 0]
len(emisiones_negativas)

OUTPUT:
3
						</code></pre>
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_3negatives.png" width="600" height="100"/>
						We have three data, corresponding to the coal of Singapore, in which it is indicated that the CO2 emissions are negative. Given the 
						years to which they correspond, and that in those years there was no energy production, only consumption, it could be interpreted as 
						that instead of emitting, they absorbed co2 from the atmosphere, which for us does not make sense and, since there are only 3 data, 
						we think it would be good to remove them from the dataframe.
						Let's take a look at how much data we have left divided by type of energy and year:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_datacounting.png" width="600" height="200"/>
						In the next graph we can see the same but each column give us the total amount of data by year in a clearer way:
						<img src="images/eda_images/co2_eda_datacounterplotly.png" width="600" height="300"/>

						In the data Russia is divided into Russia and Former U.S.S.R and Germany into Germany, Germany East and Germany West, so we are going to
						update the names because if not, the data is distorted as those countries does no longer exist.
						<pre><code>reemplazo = {"Former U.S.S.R.":"Russia","Germany, West":"Germany","Germany, East":"Germany"}
df["Country"] = df["Country"].replace(reemplazo)
						</code></pre>
						Now that we already have the dataset clean let's plot 3 of the most important features to better understand the context. In these plots 
						we are going to see the 40 more important countries by mean:
						<img src="images/eda_images/40biggestproducers.png" width="600" height="300"/>
						<img src="images/eda_images/40biggestconsumers.png" width="600" height="300"/>
						<img src="images/eda_images/40biggestemmiters.png" width="600" height="300"/>
