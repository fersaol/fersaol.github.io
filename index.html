										<h2>What About Me?</h2>
										<p>Knowing a bit of my story<br />
									
									</header>
									<p align="justify">I can not remember a time where I was not working, but on top of that, 
									I can remember that I have always had that sense of curiosity about how everything is supposed
									to work. That is a sense which has been accompaining me throughout all the time, and it is still here.
									My mind is essentially analytical and I have been always trying to improve myself along the different
									jobs that I have had, been pushed unconsciousness, at first, but consciousness later, starting from my undergraduate
									period.<br/>
									During my undergraduate study as a Business and Administration Manager I realized that I loved analyzing financial
									states because that allowed me to understand why things happened in one or another way, so that drove me to try to
									create an econometric model for my family's business. This model was able to predict the future demand so that the
									business could better adjust the purchaising policy every year. However, my father was one of those business man that
									relies more on her business knowleadge than on data, so the model did not go any further.
									During this period I also wanted to learn english, but for real, no in an academy environment, because I have always
									been more friend of the learning by doing, so I went abroad twice. The first time, I went to London during a summer period, and
									the second time I flew, or better said, flew, went on train and sail by ferry to Sethland Islands, just for learning english,
									but also to know and have a good experience. This time I stayed longer, 6 months, but regardless someone could think is not much,
									I tested that I learn new things very quickly and that the "learning by doing" really works well, at least on me. Among this two
									journeys I worked as a bank cashier at CCM and watching how my team mates worked as bank managers I though it would be a good position where
									to learn and grow. This way, after my Scotland stance I started working at BBVA Bank. In this role as a bank manager I learnt lots of
									things such be objective oriented, be flexible, to work for a common purpose as a team, but what I liked the most was analysing the client's 
									needs so we could lend them money or invest it. This role also allowed me to reinforce my analytical skills so we should determine if a loan
									was going to be approved or not and it gave me a negotiation background as I had to deal, not only with the client's claims, but also with
									the risk department until reach a good trade-off for everyone. This new world opened up my eyes to see that I wanted to dig deepper into 
									my analytical skills combining my like of technology going a step further. This new path made me get more involved in the analytical and tech 
									part and I could discover, or at least spot closer, the truth behind the data driven decision process, and really liked me. Because of that I
									decided to put all my efforts on becoming a data analyst/scientist, so I have embraced my passion and natural way of being that drives me
									through a constant self improvement and that makes me feel so good. Moreover, I would like to carry this way of self improvement and constancy
									out to wherever I go.
