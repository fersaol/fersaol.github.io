										<h2>What About Me?</h2>
										<p>Knowing a bit of my story<br />
									
									</header>
									<p align="justify">I can't remember a time when I was not working, but on top of that, 
										I can remember that I have always had a sense of curiosity about how everything is 
										supposed to work. That sense has been accompaining me along the time, 
										and it's still here. My mind is essentially, analytical and focused on continuous self 
										improvement.

										During my undergraduate studies I wanted to learn english, but for real, not in an academy 
										environment, because I have always been friend of the learning by doing more than memorizing, so I went abroad 
										twice to meet this purpose. In these places I realized that I learn new things very quickly, and that the "learning by 
										doing" really works well, at least to me. 
										Then, back to Spain I started to work for a Bank and in this role as a bank manager I learnt lots of things such 
										as:
									</p>
										<ul>
										<li>be goal oriented</li>
										<li>be flexible</li>
										<li>to work for a common purpose as a team</li>
										</ul>
									<p align="justify">
										But what I liked the most was analysing the client's needs, so I could lend them money or invest it. This 
										new world opened up my eyes to see that I wanted to dig deeper into my analytical skills combining it with 
										my like of technology. This new path made me get more involved in the analytical 
										and tech part and I could discover the data driven decision process, and really liked me. Because of 
										that I decided to start studying for data analyst/scientist. When I finished, I decided to embrace my 
										passion, and natural way of being, which drove me to a constant self improvement journey and flying abroad again towards
										Ireland looking for better opportunities. 
										Here, I discovered AWS and its cloud by the hand of Sensipass,
										a company involved in the development of a three factor authentication app. This company had all the
										app's infraestructure in the AWS cloud, so I had to learn a lot of new technologies and development concepts,
										which what I felt in love while studying for myself or making my own research in order to be able to help my colleagues.
										During this researching, I found the AWS re:start programm and I didn't doubt a second to enroll. Soon, with the
										invaluable help of Generation UK and Ireland I found out myself learning about cloud technology and leading my career into
										Cloud Support Engineer. In general, the cloud combines all my passions like analysis, development, infrastructure and technology
										within an innovative and friendly environment. Moreover, I would like to carry out this way of self 
										improvement and constancy out to wherever I go.

												<h4 style="color: orange;">AWS React-Redux Coffee Shop Web</h4>
												<p>
													This is a dynamic website made using react and redux for handling an online coffee shop.
													The architecture is a 3 tier web in a cloud infrastructue as follows:
													<ul>
														<li><strong>Amplify:</strong> delivers the web page to the client</li>
														<li><strong>Api Gateway:</strong> routes the client requests to the appropriate lambda function</li>
														<li><strong>Lambda Functions:</strong> perform the computational work and the business logic updating/getting the data from the dynamodb</li>
														<li><strong>dynamodb:</strong> stores the store products</li>
													</ul>
													Github allows us for CI/CD and redux along with redux/toolkit allows us to manage the cart, storing
													the products temporarily, until the purchase is confirmed and then it clears the store and make the changes
													needed onto the dynamodb, permanently.

													This is a dynamic website made using react, redux, redux/toolkit, bootstrap

													the candidates and assign them to continents and departments. It is hosted in AWS
													CodeCommit for CI/CD deployment through Amplify that is a managed service which builds
													the infrastructure needed for us, making easy and fast the deployment of the app.
													To upload the code we have installed the cli into the local pc and to operate through
													the different services we have had to grant access using IAM so we have generated https
													git credentials for CodeCommit and we have given permissions through a policy to allow
													CodeCommit deploy the changes to Amplify.
