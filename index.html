										<h2>What About Me?</h2>
										<p>Knowing a bit of my story<br />
									
									</header>
									<p align="justify">I can not remember a time where I was not working, but on top of that, 
										I can remember that I have always had that sense of curiosity about how everything is 
										supposed to work. That is a sense which has been accompaining me throughout all the time, 
										and it is still here. My mind is essentially, analytical and focused on continuous self 
										improving.

										During my undergraduate studies I wanted to learn english, but for real, not in an academy 
										environment, because I have always been more friend of the learning by doing, so I went abroad 
										twice. In these places I tested that I learn new things very quickly and that the "learning by 
										doing" really works well, at least on me. 
										Then I started working at BBVA Bank. In this role as a bank manager I learnt lots of things such 
										as: be objective oriented, be flexible and to work for a common purpose as a team. But what I 
										liked the most was analysing the client's needs so we could lend them money or invest it. This 
										new world opened up my eyes to see that I wanted to dig deeper into my analytical skills combining 
										my like of technology going a step further. This new path made me get more involved in the analytical 
										and tech part and I could discover the data driven decision process, and really liked me. Because of 
										that I decided to put all my efforts on becoming a data analyst/scientist, so I embraced my 
										passion and natural way of being, that drove me through a constant self improvement and to fly towards
										Ireland looking for better oportunities. Here, I discovered AWS and the cloud by the hand of Sensipass,
										a company envolved in the development of a three factor authentication app. This company had all the
										app's infraestructure in the AWS cloud so I had to learn a lot of new technologies and development concepts
										which I felt in love so studying for myself and making my own research for been able to help my colleagues
										I found out the AWS re:start programm and did not doubt a second for try to enroll in it, and now with
										invaluable help of Generation UK and Ireland I am learning about cloud technology and leading my career into
										Cloud Support Engineer where I have found a place where all my passions like analysis, development, technology
										and an innovative and friendly environment get combined. Moreover, I would like to carry this way of self 
										improvement and constancy out to wherever I go.
